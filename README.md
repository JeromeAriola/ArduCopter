# ArduCopter

not quite sure how to write a README file...

The code is very straightforward (I included some instructions in the code for the setup of some parts). You just have to tailor it for your needs, like your quad is heavy, increase the (servoName).write values.

I used a PS2 controller as my remote control. I gutted the insides, tested for the potentiometer values, and wired everything to the Arduino. I also plan on using the extra buttons for some extra controls, like landing, takeoff, and an emergency landing (if the quad is to accidentally hit the ceiling...)

I wrote this code for my first "major" Arduino project. I chose to make a quadcopter because it was my interest at the time (and still is). Due to a lack in money and resources, I decided to make my drone out of cardboard (which was reinforced with popsicle sticks and papier mache). My parts are the normal drone parts (battery, motors, ESCs, etc.).
